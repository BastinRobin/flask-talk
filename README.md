# Web Development with Flask
This is a talk I wrote and will give at Local Hack Day, with the aim of helping people become interested in developing with the Flask framework.
This repository contains the talk's manuscript along with the final code I had written by the time the talk was finished.

It is a beginner's talk on using the framework, and contains three major sections.
* [Installing Flask](https://github.com/jackcook/flask-talk/blob/master/flask-talk.md#installing-flask)
* [Hello, World!](https://github.com/jackcook/flask-talk/blob/master/flask-talk.md#hello-world)
* [Dynamic HTML Files](https://github.com/jackcook/flask-talk/blob/master/flask-talk.md#dynamic-html-files)
* [URL Handling](https://github.com/jackcook/flask-talk/blob/master/flask-talk.md#url-handling)
